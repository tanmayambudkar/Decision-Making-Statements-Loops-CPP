# Aim: To study and implement C++ decision making statements Loops
# Theory:

Loops are used to make the program less repetitive and compact by iterating a part of a
program several times. Thus, they are also called repetitive control structures. 

# There are two main types of loops:
a)	for loop 

b)	while/do-while loop.

#	For Loop
A for loop is used when we know the number of iterations of the block of code (i.e.) if the number of iterations is fixed. The flow of control of a 'for loop' is initialization, condition, and increment/decrement, separated from each other with a semicolon. The first step is to initialize the variable(s) used in the loop which is done only once at the start of the loop. Next, the condition is checked- if satisfied loop is executed otherwise jumps to the next block of code without execution. Finally, the variable initialized gets increased or decreased after every execution of the loop till the condition is satisfied.

# While Loop
A while loop is used when we do not know the number of iterations required (i.e.) if the number of iterations is unfixed. The 'while loop' is specified with a condition and as long as this condition holds true or is satisfied, the while loop gets executed. The condition specified could be any expression in the conditional statements. If the condition becomes false, the block of code immediately following the loop gets executed.

Infinite Loops:

An infinite loop (sometimes called an endless loop) is a piece of coding that lacks a functional exit so that it repeats indefinitely. An infinite loop occurs when a condition is always evaluated to be true.

Nesting of Loops:

Nesting of loops refers to placing one loop inside another. The inner loop is executed completely for each iteration of the outer loop. This is useful when you need to perform multiple iterations within each iteration of a larger loop, such as iterating over a two-dimensional array or performing operations that require more than one level of iteration.

# Implementation:
The Logic and conditional flow of the statements were seen through the following programs :
+ Printing even numbers from 1 to 10
+ reversing of integer values
+ Simple login through password
+ Patterns(Star Patterns, Floyd's series)
# Conclusion:
Through the programs , The logic and operation of loops in C++ has been studied.
