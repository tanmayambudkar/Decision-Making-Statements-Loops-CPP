# Aim: To study and implement C++ decision making statements Loops
# Theory:

Loops are used to make the program less repetitive and compact by iterating a part of a

program several times. Thus, they are also called repetitive control structures. 

# There are two main types of loops:
a)	for loop 

b)	while/do-while loop.

#	For Loop
A for loop is used when we know the number of iterations of the block of code (i.e.) if the number of iterations is fixed. The flow of control of a 'for loop' is initialization, condition, and increment/decrement, separated from each other with a semicolon. The first step is to initialize the variable(s) used in the loop which is done only once at the start of the loop. Next, the condition is checked- if satisfied loop is executed otherwise jumps to the next block of code without execution. Finally, the variable initialized gets increased or decreased after every execution of the loop till the condition is satisfied.
